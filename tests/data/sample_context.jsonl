I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat o\u0001 \u0002rost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as th\u0001 \u0002egion of beauty and delight. There, Margaret, the sun is for eve\u0001 \u0002isible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing \u0001 \u0002erpetual splendour.

But supposing all these conjectures to be false, yo\u0001 \u0002annot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on al\u0001 \u0002ankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pol\u0001 \u0002o those countries, to reach which at present so many months ar\u0001 \u0002equisite; or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet, which, if a\u0001 \u0002ll possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.", "language": "en"}
